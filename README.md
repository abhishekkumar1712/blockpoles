Problems in current economic system 
centralization is directly proportional to risk our current economic financial system is far more centralized if we some how make it decentralised then the war of economix warfare is already win win 
because risk impact is law in decentralised environment bartar system of financel and economic sytem is far more decentralised 
and far more secure then our current economic sytem and again we have a technology like blockchain which can take us back to the bartar 
system but in far more efficent way yess there is some security issues not that much things can be done 

one frame economy it means every asset is going in one direction so
